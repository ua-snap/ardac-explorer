        Climate Stripes: Understanding Variability and Scale
      </h3>
      <p>
        Climate stripes. Warming stripes. Color bars. You&rsquo;ve seen them on
        walls and on stickers and on shirts and protest signs but….
      </p>
      <h4>What are they and where do they come from?</h4>
      <p>
        <img

      <p>
        The graphic is a great example of convergent ideas with two scientists
        at the University of Reading and another at the University of Georgia
        seemingly independently coming up with the idea. Here at the University
        of Alaska Fairbanks
        <a
          href="https://uaf-iarc.org/2022/07/iarcs-giant-climate-stripes-boldly-proclaim-arctic-change"
          >IARC climate scientists like Rick Thoman and John Walsh</a
        >
        have been using them to tell stories about climate for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these data visualizations each stripe represents a year, with the
        color of the bar determined by the average temperature for that year.
        Typically this is the average temperature for the year at 2m elevation,
        or just over average head height. The stripes are colored with the
        darkest blue for the coldest year in that location, to the brightest red
        for the hottest year in that location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put it on a sticker or a wall and there you go; an arresting data
        visualization of temperature. The world&rsquo;s getting warmer. But what
        else can we learn from these stripes by looking just a tiny bit closer?
      </p>

      <h4 class="title is-4">
        Similar trends are apparent over different temperature ranges
      </h4>

      <p>
        Here&rsquo;s a climate stripes graphic using gridded modeled historical
        data for Utqia&gdot;vik, the northernmost community in the United States
        on the north slope of Alaska:
      </p>

      <figure class="image">
        <img
          src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/Utqiagvik Climate Stripes 2022.png"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        And here are the climate stripes for Metlakatla, Alaska using the same
        historical dataset:
      </p>

      <figure class="image">
        <img
          src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/Metlakatla_stripes_2023_cropped.png"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Mean annual temperatures in Utqiagvik are around -10&deg;C (15&deg;F)
        while in Metlakatla, the southernmost community in the state near the
        border with British Columbia, the annual average temperature is closer
        to +10&deg;C (50&deg;F). The common color palette across very different
        places, with different baseline climates, allows us to compare warming
        trends easily across latitudes and climates.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking across the world we can see that this means that in spite of
        their different climate both Maine and Arizona are warming, though this
        means different things for each place:
      </p>
      <p>...a shorter snow-machining season in Maine...</p>
      <figure class="image">
        <img src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/ME-tavg.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        ...but 100&deg;F+ summer days in Arizona straining the power
        grid&hellip;
      </p>
      <figure class="image">
        <img src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/AZ-tavg.png" />
      </figure>

      <h4 class="title is-4">
        Year-to-year variation is obvious, but trends are pronounced
      </h4>

      <p>
        Okay, let&rsquo;s stick closer to home. Alaska&rsquo;s state capitol,
        Juneau, is a very neat but also pretty unique place. Off the road
        system, the state&rsquo;s 3rd largest city is surrounded by mountains,
        islands, and America&rsquo;s largest national forest. Here are the
        climate stripes for Juneau:
      </p>
      <figure class="image">
        <img
          src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/Juneau Climate Stripes 2022.png"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        The variation of local weather is obvious across these stripes. This
        deep blue line represents 1972, the coldest year in the record with an
        average annual temperature of just 3.7&deg;C (39&deg;F). The warmest
        year though, is the most recent for this data…2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall though the trend is clear. Some warmer than average years do
        exist in the early 1900&rsquo;s and a few colder than average years
        occurred more recently, but overall a trend toward more red and less
        blue is obvious across the stripes. Year to year variability can be
        caused by specific storm patterns, recurring cycles like El Ni&ntilde;o,
        or just plain chance. Understanding this variability is key to
        understanding why climate science comes with ranges and variability
        built in.
      </p>
      <p>The world is messy and our data should reflect that.</p>

      <h4 class="title is-4">Variation is smoothed by scale</h4>
      <p>
        As humans we&rsquo;re only ever in one place at any given time, so the
        climate stripes of your home community feel powerful. You remember that
        warm year with no snow, or that frigid year that drove up your heating
        bill. This is powerful, but data also allows us to expand beyond the
        single point and understand our local climate in the context of the
        trends at broader scales.
      </p>
      <p>
        288,000 Alaskans live in our largest city, Anchorage. Here&rsquo;s what
        the climate stripes for the City and Borough of Anchorage look like:
      </p>

      <p class="is-size-6">
        Note because of the data used that these stripes begin in 1940, not
        1900.
      </p>

      <figure class="image">
        <img
          src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/AnchorageMuni_ERA5_stripes_2023_cropped.png"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        But most folks who know the state will tell you that Anchorage is part
        of a broader &lsquo;population core&rsquo; in the south-central part of
        Alaska. While it can be hard to draw precise lines around this
        population core, we&rsquo;ll expand out using a climatological
        perspective.
      </p>
      <figure class="image">
        <img src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/CookInletMap.jpg" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        The &ldquo;Cook Inlet Climate Division&rdquo; encompasses most of the
        larger towns of the area including Soldotna, Wasilla, Palmer, and Homer.
        All told this region covers the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and the
        northern half of the Kenai Peninsula hemmed in by mountains on three
        sides and with its local climate dominated by the temperature-moderating
        waters of the Cook Inlet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here&rsquo;s what the climate stripes for this area with a population of
        over 400,000, well over half the state, looks like:
      </p>
      <figure class="image">
        <img
          src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/CookInlet_ERA5_2023_cropped.png"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        Local weather and unique climates can seriously affect how climate
        change in these stripes look at the community level. A loss of sea ice
        cover or a shortening winter snow cover season may amplify the change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let&rsquo;s zoom out further. Here are the climate stripes for the state
        of Alaska, from Attu to Kaktovik to Sitka to Kodiak and all:
      </p>
      <figure class="image">
        <img
          src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/Alaska Climate Stripes 2022 (1).png"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        As you can see, an even wider area means an even greater smoothing of
        the trends. As we consider a broader area, the local impacts of rivers,
        elevation, mountain ranges, proximity to the ocean, and other factors
        get averaged out. At these wider scales fewer years stand out and the
        stripes begin to look more like a slow but steady march from blue to red
        reflecting the broader climate&rsquo;s warming trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        For good measure let&rsquo;s take a peek at the stripes for the entire
        circumpolar Arctic:
      </p>
      <figure class="image">
        <img
          src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/ClimateStripes_Arctic_2022.png"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        The Arctic is warming faster than any other area of the globe so
        it&rsquo;s not surprising to see things looking this clear. At this
        scale the last colder-than-average year in the Arctic was 1992.
      </p>
      <p>And as we look at the stripes for the globe:</p>
      <figure class="image">
        <img
          src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/GLOBE---1850-2023-MO.png"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        The trend dominates the graphic. We got these non-Arctic stripes from
        <a href="https://showyourstripes.info">another tool</a> by the way. We
        don&rsquo;t handle global data.
      </p>

      <h4>The power, and shortcomings, of a good climate graphic</h4>
      <p>
        Overall the Climate Stripes graphics for points and for regions are a
        powerful tool. They are (mostly) colorblind-friendly and simply show the
        facts of climate change: the trend toward a warmer climate is both clear
        and striking.
      </p>
      <p>It also allows people to see the effect in their specific place.</p>
      <div class="tile is-ancestor">
        <div class="tile is-parent">
          <div class="tile is-child">
            <p>My Region</p>
            <img
              src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/ArcticStripesWaterisStripes.png"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="tile is-child">
            <p>My State</p>
            <img
              src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/AKStripesAKShaped.png"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="tile is-child">
            <p>My City</p>
            <img
              src="assets/images/ClimateStripesStory1/Fairbanks Climate Stripes 2022-01 (square).png"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        But there are shortcomings. If you want to know the precise values of
        any given year from these stripes you&rsquo;ll have to dive into the
        data behind it, and a less clear trend in one specific area can be
        improperly generalized without the right context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally these stripes typically only display historical data, so
        they don&rsquo;t offer insights into the possible futures in a given
        place. With just a few tweaks, they can do precisely that. Continue to
        the second part of this series, where we
