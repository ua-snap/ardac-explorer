        Access to large distributed data volumes has been a limiting factor for
        researchers in Alaska, which puts them at a disadvantage. Establishing
        the Arctic Climate Data Node (ACDN) at UAF provides never&ndash;before
        realized local access to cutting-edge global climate model data.

          the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) has established the Arctic

          in the development of new derived data products.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ACDN will facilitate the development of new research themes,
          process&ndash;based modeling, mechanistic modeling, and regional
          synthesis at UAF and within the broader Arctic science community. The
          node establishes research computing infrastructure to support local
          storage and access to key datasets. This will provide significant
          capacity&ndash;building to Alaska's research community members and
          rightsholders as they address the ongoing challenges of a changing
          climate.

            <strong>Local data access:</strong> The ACDN is a workspace for
            University of Alaska affiliated researchers with a repository of
            CMIP6 data attached directly to the

            The SNAP Application Program Interface (API) provides programmatic
            access to CMIP6 data, allowing users to query and download data
            directly from the command line or within their own applications. The
            API supports a wide range of query parameters, including model,
            scenario, variable, and geographic region, enabling users to extract
            specific subsets of data or perform complex analyses directly within
            the API.
            <br />

            Rasdaman: The ACDN provides a
            <strong>multidimensional raster datacube</strong> for data analysis
            and mapping. Users can access CMIP6 data from rasdaman using the
            standards-based OGC formats for web mapping and coverage requests:
            WMS, and WCS/WCPS. This can be integrated into GIS platforms or used
            to extract data for local analysis.

                continued population growth and increasing demand for energy and
                resources. Despite technological advancements, efforts to
                mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are limited, resulting in a
                high-forcing scenario with extensive climate change impacts.
                Environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, and social
                inequalities escalate, exacerbating global challenges.
                Adaptation measures are reactive and often inadequate, leading
                to significant disruptions and irreversible damage to ecosystems
                and societies.

        <p>
          The ACDN operates as a robust storage infrastructure employing BeeGFS,
          a distributed file system technology. This setup ensures swift access
          to object storage servers via a blazing-fast 100 Gb/s network.
          Leveraging the ample storage capacity of this system, SNAP can
          efficiently store, regrid, and bias-correct data pertinent to the
          state of Alaska. Future opportunities include

          >
          across Alaska's expanse and crafting additional climate indicators,
          beyond the current offerings of summer days, winter days, maximum
          1-day precipitation, and freeze/thaw cycles.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Rasdaman, an array database</h4>

        <p>
          Rasdaman is an open&ndash;source software for managing massive arrays
          of multi&ndash;dimensional data, primarily used in scientific and
          geospatial applications. It&rsquo;s designed to efficiently store,
          retrieve, and analyze large&ndash;scale raster data, such as satellite
          imagery, climate data, and simulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of Rasdaman&rsquo;s key features is its ability to handle
          multi&ndash;dimensional data sets, enabling users to store and query
          data along multiple axes, such as time, space, and spectral
          dimensions. It supports a wide range of data formats and provides
          powerful query capabilities for extracting specific subsets of data or
          performing complex analyses directly within the database.

        </p>

        <p>
          Users can quickly access CMIP6 data using SNAP&rsquo;s Rasdaman server
          and WCS, WCPS, or WMS queries. For example, the WCS query below
          returns a subset of the multidimensional CMIP6 data in NetCDF format
          that can be processed in various environments:
        </p>

        <p>
          Data can be analyzed and visualized directly from the WCS response,
          e.g.:
        </p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/mean_june_air_temperature.png"
            alt="Mean June Air Temperature"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Many of SNAP&rsquo;s datasets are available as Rasdaman coverages. See
          <a href="#replacethis">this notebook</a> for a tutorial on how to use
          these services in your own work.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Globus</h4>

        <p>
          Globus is a secure, reliable, and scalable data management platform
          that enables researchers to easily move, share, and analyze large
          volumes of data. It provides a user-friendly interface for
          transferring data between storage systems, sharing data with
          collaborators, and automating data workflows. Globus&rsquo; powerful
          data management capabilities make it an ideal solution for researchers
          working with large datasets, such as CMIP6 climate model data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users equipped with a Globus account can seamlessly navigate the ACDN
          file storage system to retrieve data, transferring it to any system
          where they hold a Globus account. This encompasses an array of major
          national laboratories with supercomputing capabilities.
