          Our team of scientists and researchers have prepared a curated set of
          the CMIP6 series of climate model data. We have selected 13 models
          which demonstrate high performance in the Arctic, and have done
          significant geospatial data processing to put the data on a common
          grid as well as downscaling to 4km resolution over Alaska.

          We wish to thank Dr. John Walsh for supporting this work from <a href="https://en.uit.no/mohnprize/laureates/art?p_document_id=773167">
            his
            award from the Mohn Prize in 2022
          </a>. Dr. Walsh&rsquo;s research and
          service epitomize how future development of the Arctic depends upon
          our ability to understand the connections between all components of
          the Arctic system, from the ocean and atmosphere to ice, land and
          people of the North. In proactively seeking to bring into the realm of
          policy-making and public knowledge the best of this type of
          coupled-system science, in which he excels as both leader and team
          member, he stands as a towering figure in the studies of modern Arctic
          change.
        </p>

          Carrying this work forward, Dr. Jeremy Littell and geospatial data
          scientist Kyle Redilla are working to make these products available.
          Below, you can explore the data that are ready today.
