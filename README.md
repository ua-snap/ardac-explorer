### Adding a new item

Determine a 'slug' for the item.  The slug is a unique but human-readable ID for the item that will be visible in the URL.

1. Add the slug for the new item to `types/slugs.d.ts`
2. Add any new tags for the new item to `types/tags.d.ts`
3. Add the item in `assets/items.ts`:
    * `slug`: the slug ID
    * `title`: the 'headline'
    * `blurb`: **short** text description, single line/paragraph, no HTML please
    * `tags`: array of tags
    * `image`: image filename, corresponds to `public/previews` folder
    * `imageAlt`: alt text for accessibility

The item is now available for use in static layouts and will be included in any pages that display all results for a tag.  Static examples:

```html
<!-- display only headline, show primary tag -->
<ItemBrief slug="indicator-ftc" showTag />

<!-- headline + blurb, no tags shown -->
<ItemText slug="sea-ice-concentration" />

<!-- headline, blurb, photo (if present), don't show tags -->
<ItemTextPicture slug="indicator-dw" />
```

To build the actual content for the item, add a Vue component in `components/global` named according to the slug pattern in CamelCase, i.e. `map-permafrost` would become `MapPermafrost`.  From the command line in the root of the project directory:

```bash
npx nuxi add component global/MapPermafrost
```

...which will add a Vue SFC file in the right place.  Now, that component can be accessed by clicking on the item you just created.

#### Connecting people / bios 

When adding an item, consider if you should tag a person with the bio brief.  The guidelines are approximate, but consider doing this when:

 * It's a narrative story item
 * It's a new thing
 * The people you'd tag created the data or tech.  (If SNAP techs just do QA/QC and ingest/prep, we would not tag them; same for programmers who worked on features).  

 Use the `Bios` component, for example,

 `<Bios :people="['Hajo Eicken', 'Scott Rupp']" />`

When adding someone new:

 * add an image to `/public/images/people`
 * add them to the `types/people.d.ts`
 * add the bio itself in `assets/bios.ts`
 * add the person to the `/people` page

#### Converting Jupyter notebooks to items

Follow the pattern used in the `global/NotebookPermObsTemp` component.  To transform the HTML before copy/pasting it into the slot, activate a Conda environment with Jupyter and `nbconvert` and `tidy` (probably already installed in MacOS) then:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --template basic notebook.ipynb
tidy -i -m notebook.html
sed -i '' 's/class\=\"input\"//' notebook.html
```

This does a bit of cleanup and removes one class that will clash with Bulma.  Finally, copy paste everything in the `<body>` tag of the cleaned HTML into the `<slot>` in the `NotebookTemplate` component.
