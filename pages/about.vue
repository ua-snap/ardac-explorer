      <p>
        The Arctic Data Collaborative (ARDAC) is a data service that provides
        access and analysis for Arctic data and interactive tools. ARDAC is not
        a data archive. Instead of simply serving raw data, it offers vetted and
        pre-processed datasets to streamline visualization and further
        processing of data, and allow for faster research discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're hosting an extensive catalog of curated Arctic-specific data, the
        majority of which has been collected and generated by University of
        Alaska researchers. By building capacity for those same researchers to
        access and develop technologies that meet the growing needs of a
        changing Arctic we're also seeking to mitigate the competitive
        disadvantage of those very same researchers in proposal submissions by
        putting the supporting infrastructure at their fingertips.

        We are making data more usable and alive for
        <a href="people">people</a> who need it. ARDAC has been constructed
        thanks to the hard work of our research collaborators and the support of
        the

        This tool uses the <a href="http://www.rasdaman.org/">rasdaman</a> array
        database management system. This technology enables our team to store,
        analyze and visualize the climate data that are presented through this
        interface. We wish to thank the rasdaman project and team for their
        inspiration and support, and for providing this important innovation in
        data technology.
